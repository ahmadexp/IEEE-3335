P3335: 1PPS Requirement
A proposal by Doug Arnold
2024-06-24

An IEEE Std 3335-202x Time Card shall have a one pulse per second (1PPS) output.  The output connector shall be a SMA or mechanically equivalent female connector.  The 1PPS signal shall have the following properties:
TTL into 50 Ohms
Rising edge is the on-time mark
Pulse is at least 1 us, and at most 0.5 seconds
The rise time of the rising edge of the 1PPS signal shall be less than 10 ns, 10% to 90% of the low to high voltage levels.  The agreement off all other timing outputs of the time card to the 1PPS shall be stated in the time card specifications.  The agreement specifications shall all be less than 100 ns.

The following normative references need to be added:
MIL-STD-348A (SMA connector specification)
