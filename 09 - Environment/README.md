# Environmental Specifications (Normative)

This chapter defines the environmental, mechanical, and reliability requirements applicable to all TimeCard implementations. These specifications ensure that TimeCards operate reliably under diverse deployment conditions—ranging from data centers and telecommunications environments to industrial or field installations—while maintaining timing precision and conformance to the unified timescale.

## 1 - Overview

TimeCards are precision timing subsystems whose performance is directly influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, shock, and electromagnetic interference.  
All implementations **SHALL** specify their environmental operating limits, test methodologies, and mitigation measures in compliance with applicable international standards.

Environmental performance **SHOULD** be validated through qualification testing to verify stable frequency, phase, and time accuracy across the declared operating range.

## 2 - Operating Conditions

### 2.1 - Temperature
- **Operating Range:** Each TimeCard **SHALL** define a continuous operating temperature range (e.g., 0°C to +55°C for data center, or −40°C to +85°C for industrial use).  
- **Storage Range:** Vendors **SHALL** specify safe storage temperatures and humidity levels.  
- **Thermal Stability:** Oscillator frequency drift versus temperature **SHALL** be characterized and documented.  
- **Compensation:** Devices employing OCXO or TCXO **SHOULD** include temperature compensation logic or calibration tables.  
- **Thermal Alarms:** Management telemetry **SHALL** include over- and under-temperature warning thresholds.

### 2.2 - Humidity
- **Operating Humidity:** 5% to 95% non-condensing, unless otherwise specified.  
- Conformal coating or sealing **SHOULD** be applied for humid or corrosive environments.  
- Condensation prevention measures **SHALL** be verified under thermal cycling.

### 2.3 - Altitude and Airflow
- Operating altitude **SHALL** be defined (typically 0–3000 m).  
- Host airflow assumptions **MUST** be documented, including minimum cubic feet per minute (CFM) for heat dissipation.  
- Passive or active cooling methods **SHOULD** maintain oscillator core temperature within calibrated limits.

## 3 - Mechanical and Structural Requirements

### 3.1 - Form Factor

- TimeCards **SHALL** withstand mechanical shock and vibration consistent with IEC 60068-2-6 (vibration) and IEC 60068-2-27 (shock).  
- Oscillator modules **MUST** be mechanically isolated from high-frequency vibration.  
- Frequency stability degradation under mechanical stress **SHOULD NOT** exceed ±5 × 10⁻¹¹ per g RMS.

### 3.3 - Connectors and Retention
- All RF and timing ports **MUST** be impedance-matched (typically 50 Ω) and use locking or threaded connectors (e.g., SMA, MCX).  
- Faceplate labeling **SHALL** clearly identify each port (GNSS, PPS, 10 MHz, ToD, MGMT).  
- Cable strain relief **SHOULD** be incorporated to prevent mechanical fatigue.

## 4 - Electrical and Power Environment

### 4.1 - Power Supply
- TimeCards **SHALL** define voltage rails and tolerances (e.g., +12 V ±5%, +3.3 V ±3%).  
- Devices powered via host buses (e.g., PCIe) **MUST** comply with bus sequencing and current draw limits.  
- External power connectors **SHALL** include reverse-polarity and surge protection.  
- Energy storage (e.g., supercapacitor or battery) **SHOULD** sustain holdover operation during brief outages.

### 4.2 - Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC)
- All implementations **MUST** meet the target market’s EMC emission and immunity requirements (e.g., EN 55032, EN 55035, FCC Part 15 Class A/B).  
- Shielding and grounding **SHALL** minimize coupling between digital and RF domains.  
- Oscillator enclosures **SHOULD** be metal-shielded to prevent phase noise degradation due to EMI.

### 4.3 - Electrostatic Discharge (ESD)
- ESD protection **MUST** be provided on all external connectors per IEC 61000-4-2.  
- Handling procedures and warning labels **SHALL** be included in manufacturing and user documentation.

## 5 - Environmental Qualification Tests

All TimeCards intended for production **SHOULD** undergo the following qualification tests or equivalent validated procedures:

| Test | Standard | Purpose |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Thermal Cycling | IEC 60068-2-14 | Validate stability across temperature extremes |
| Humidity Endurance | IEC 60068-2-78 | Assess corrosion and moisture protection |
| Shock | IEC 60068-2-27 | Ensure mechanical survivability |
| Vibration | IEC 60068-2-6 | Confirm frequency stability under vibration |
| ESD Immunity | IEC 61000-4-2 | Verify protection against static discharge |
| EMC Emission/Immunity | EN 55032 / EN 55035 | Regulatory compliance |
| Power Interruption | IEC 61000-4-11 | Evaluate restart and holdover recovery |

Performance deviation **MUST NOT** exceed the vendor’s declared tolerance during or after qualification testing.
